# Takeout Restaurant Order System

## Description

The Takeout Restaurant Order System is a Python application that allows customers to view a menu, place an order, and receive an itemized receiptâ€”all via the command line. This project is designed with accessibility in mind for customers with hearing and vocal impairments, enabling them to place their orders without the need for direct verbal communication. The project leverages core Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, list comprehensions, and data structures (dictionaries and lists) to manage menu items and orders.

   - When prompted, enter the quantity you desire. If an invalid quantity is provided, the system will default the quantity to 1.

   - Enter any key to continue ordering.
   - Type `n` or `N` to finish your order.

4. **View Receipt:**

   - Each ordered menu item along with its price and quantity.
   - The total cost of your order.
